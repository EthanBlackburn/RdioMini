## RdioMini

It is what it sounds like! It's a super hacky attempt to make a mini
player for [Rdio](http://rd.io).

## The story

I woke up one Sunday morning and saw this
[beauty](http://dribbble.com/shots/839571-Rdio-Mini-Player?list=users)
by [Alex Vanderzon](http://dribbble.com/Vanderzon). I had been wanting
to hack on a Mac/iOS app for a while, and just decided to make it. So,
he sent me over the PSDs, and I happened to make something work.

## Known Bugs

There are a few bugs in the Rdio AppleScript dictionary, such as:

* buggy/inconsistent album art

* buggy currentProgress time

There are also a few features that are not yet available:

* setter method for `shuffle`

* setter method for `repeat`

## Anyways...
